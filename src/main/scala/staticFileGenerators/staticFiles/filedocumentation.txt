The Beijing Language and Culture University created a balanced corpus of 15 billion characters.
It’s based on news (人民日报 1946-2018，人民日报海外版 2000-2018), literature (books by 472 authors,
including a significant portion of non-Chinese writers), non-fiction books,
blog and weibo entries as well as classical Chinese.
